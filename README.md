# Digits Classification and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves the classification and analysis of handwritten digit images using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to load the digits dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement classification models such as logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks. The models are then evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports to determine their effectiveness in digit classification.

## Installation
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using `pip`.

## Usage
To run the notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and follow the steps provided in the `Final.ipynb` file.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
- **Import Data:** Loads the digits dataset from `sklearn`.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes code for visualizing the digits dataset to understand the distribution and patterns in the data.
- **Modeling:** Implements machine learning models for digit classification, such as logistic regression, SVM, or neural networks.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates the models using appropriate metrics and visualizations, including accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Results
The project demonstrates how different machine learning models can be applied to classify digits. The results include:

- **Accuracy Scores:** The performance of various models in terms of accuracy.
- **Confusion Matrices:** Visualization of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Classification Reports:** Detailed performance metrics for each class, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
